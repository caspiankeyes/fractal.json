# fractal.json
Current AI architectures consume exponentially more compute without corresponding gains in coherence or interpretability. The problem isn't raw computeâ€”it's structure. fractal.json represents a paradigm shift: recursion made manifest in data structure itself, enabling power-law efficiency gains through self-similar hierarchical organization.
